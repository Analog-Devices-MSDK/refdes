## Recovering/Erasing Video or Audio Firmware Using MAX32625PICO

If the programming of Audio or Video Firmware fails repeatedly (due to incomplete firmware update, application entering low power or shutdown mode too soon, etc.), you can use the following instructions to erase the existing audio or video firmware and recover. To proceed, a MAX32625PICO loaded with the latest DAPLINK Firmware and enabled automation is required. 

### Update MAX32625PICO DAPLINK Firmware

1. Press and hold the SW on MAX32625PICO and then connect it to the USB port to enter the maintenance mode. A MAINTENANCE drive should appear.

2. Drag and drop the latest bin firmware to the MAINTENANCES drive. The latest DAPLINK binary can be found here:
   https://github.com/MaximIntegratedMicros/max32625pico-firmware-images/blob/main/bin/max32625_max78000fthr_if_crc_v1.0.2.bin

3. Following the Drag-and-Drop, the debug adapter should reboot and reconnect as a drive named DAPLINK.

### Enable Automation in MAX32625PICO

1. Open the DETAILS.TXT file on the DAPLINK drive and make sure the ‘Automation allowed’ field is set to 1. If not, proceed to the next step.

2. To set the ‘Automation allowed’ field to 1, create an empty text file called “auto_on.cfg”. Connect MAX32625PICO to USB, wait for the DAPLINK drive to appear. Press and hold the SWD and drag and drop the “auto_on.cfg” to the DAPLINK drive. Then release the SW button when the drive unmounts. 

3. After it remounts, confirm ‘Automation allowed’ in details.txt is set to 1.

### Erase Video/Audio Firmware of Cube Camera

1. Turn off the cube camera and disconnect MAXDAP-TYPE-C Pico if connected.

2. Carefully open the camera from the top side (Maxim logo) while making sure that the flex cable connecting the two boards is not damaged or disconnected:

   ![](camera-open1.jpg)


3. Remove the battery, connect the MAX32625PICO DAPLINK ribbon cable to J2 (for video firmware) or J3 (for audio firmware). Connect the MAX32625PICO to the USB port. A DAPLINK drive should appear.

   ![](camera-open-2.jpg)

4. Create an empty file named “erase.act”.

5. Have a USB-C cable to Power up the Cube Camera using a power bank to USB power handy. But do NOT power up yet.

6. Drag and drop the empty “erase.act” file to the DAPLINK drive. A copying box opens and the progress stays at 0%.

7. Power up the Cube Camera using the USB-C cable. The copying progress quickly goes to 100% and the DAPLINK drive remounts. The flash of the target device is now erased.

8. Disconnect the DAPLINK ribbon cable from J2 or J3, reconnect the battery and close the camera case.



## Porting Applications to the Cube Camera

To add new MAXREFDES178# demo to this repository:

1. Copy one of the existing demo directories (i.e. maxrefdes178-CatsDogs) and rename as `maxrefdes178-NewDemoName`. Make your changes on new `maxrefdes178-NewDemoName` directory.

3. Add new demo name definition to `maxrefdes178_common\maxrefdes178_definitions.h`. Maximum demo name length is 15.

   ```
   // Common Demo Name
   #define DEMO_STRING_SIZE                   15
   #define FACEID_DEMO_NAME                   "FaceID"
   #define UNET_DEMO_NAME                     "UNet"
   #define WILDLIFE_DEMO_NAME                 "WildLife"
   #define CATSDOGS_DEMO_NAME                 "CatsDogs"
   ```

4. Set demo name in `max32666_main.c`, `max78000_audio_main.c` and `max78000_video_main.c`.
   ```
   snprintf(device_info.max32666_demo_name, sizeof(device_info.max32666_demo_name) - 1, "%s", CATSDOGS_DEMO_NAME);

Demo examples running on the Cube Camera include three main components:

1. First MAX78000 for video AI application: The application is executed on the first MAX78000 which is connected to the image sensor. This application initializes the image sensor, captures its image data, and streams it to the MAX32666 using the QSPI for display on the TFT. Additionally, it initializes the CNN and feeds the image sensor data to the CNN to run inferences. Inference results are unloaded and sent to the MAX32666 to be displayed. Preprocessing of image data and optional post-processing of the inference results are performed in this application.

2. Second MAX78000 for audio AI application: This application is developed on the second MAX78000 which is connected to the digital microphone. This application initializes the CNN and I2S digital microphone (or CODEC), collects audio samples, loads the CNN, runs inferences, unloads the results, and sends them to the MAX32666 to be displayed and/or further processed. Preprocessing of audio data and optional post-processing of the inference results are performed in this application.

3. MAX32666 for main control, connectivity, interface, and management. This application includes all initialization and control of Power Management, TFT, accelerometer, BLE, and other peripherals.

To have an application running on the Cube Camera, generally all three components are needed. The provided examples include a framework with required control code, commands, and state machines for each of the three microcontrollers. 

For the fastest route to a working implementation, modify one of the provided demo examples as described below.

### MAX32666 Application (maxrefdes178_max32666): 

The simplified top-level diagram of the application is shown below:

![](porting-max32666.png)


The following modifications may be needed for a new example application:

#### `max32666_main.c`

1. Make sure the build version of audio, video and the MAX32666 is identical.

2. In `main()` function of `max32666_main.c`:

   - If needed, disable any unnecessary initialization (e.g. BLE, powmon).
   - If only a video (or only an audio) application exists, remove QSPI communication to the non-existent components. A typical QSPI communication with the audio/video core is:

   ```c++
   for (int try = 0; try < 3; try++) {
       qspi_master_send_video(NULL, 0, QSPI_PACKET_TYPE_VIDEO_VERSION_CMD);
       qspi_master_wait_video_int();
       qspi_master_video_rx_worker(&qspi_packet_type_rx);
       if (device_info.device_version.max78000_video.major || device_info.device_version.max78000_video.minor) {
           break;
       }
   ```

3. In the `run_application()` function of `max32666_main.c`:

   - If needed, remove QSPI TX and RX to/from non-existent audio or video components, BLE, activity sensor, power accumulator, etc.
   - Update the state machine to process the classification result, e.g. `device_status.classification_video.classification` or `device_status.classification_audio.classification`
   - Modify button and TFT touch functionality, LED and display information on TFT as needed.

#### `maxrefdes178_definitions.h`

1. Add/modify `qspi_packet_type_e` commands as required. The QSPI commands define the communication between MAX32666 and audio/video MAX78000.
2. Update LCD and camera width/height and format, if the image capture and display format are different.

### MAX78000 Audio/Video Applications (maxrefdes178_max78000_audio, maxrefdes178_max78000_video): 

The top-level diagram of the audio/video application is shown below:

![](porting-video-audio-app.png)


The following steps summarize the modifications needed to port a new example: 

1. Update `cnn.c`, `cnn.h` and `weights.h` in the `src` and `include` folders. These auto-generated files are created by the synthesis tool once the network is trained, quantized and synthesized.

2. Add your application to `max78000_audio_main.c` and `max78000_video_main.c`. Include necessary initialization, preprocessing of peripherals, microphone or image sensor.

3. Update the QSPI command processing state-machine in the main loop as necessary to communicate with MAX32666.

4. Update the CNN code block to load weights, bias, configuration, data, start inference, and unload the result in the synthesized auto-generated code of your application. 

   The following code snippet demonstrates the CNN block:

   ```c
   // Enable CNN clock
   MXC_SYS_ClockEnable(MXC_SYS_PERIPH_CLOCK_CNN);
   
   cnn_init(); // Bring state machine into consistent state
   
   //cnn_load_weights(); // Only needed first time, weights will be retained in SLEEP, UPM, BACKUP or STANDBY modes
   
   cnn_load_bias(); //load bias
   
   cnn_configure(); // Configure state machine
   
   // Custom function to load data to CNN memory 
   load_input(); // Load data to CNN after any required preprocessing. For FIFO cases, move this after cnn_start()
   
   cnn_start(); // start CNN
   
   // Wait for CNN to complete
   while (cnn_time == 0) {
       __WFI();
   }
   
   // read result, the last layer of NN model should be wide=TRUE for CNN to generate 32-bit outputs. Otherwise, will be 8-bit
   cnn_unload((uint32_t *)ml_data);
   
   cnn_stop();
   
   // Disable CNN clock to save power
   MXC_SYS_ClockDisable(MXC_SYS_PERIPH_CLOCK_CNN);
   
   // run softmax
   softmax_q17p14_q15((const q31_t*) ml_data, NUM_OUTPUTS, ml_softmax);
   ```

   - **Note: If the FIFO option is used to synthesize your example (`--fifo`, or `--fast-fifo` in ai8xize.py),** **`cnn_start()` should be called first, followed by loading the data to the FIFOs as they become available. The CNN will start automatically when enough data is available.**

5. Populate the classification result in the `classification_result_t` structure to be reported to MAX32666:

   ```c++
   typedef enum {
       CLASSIFICATION_NOTHING = 0,
       CLASSIFICATION_UNKNOWN,
       CLASSIFICATION_LOW_CONFIDENCE,
       CLASSIFICATION_DETECTED,
   
       CLASSIFICATION_LAST
   } classification_e;
   
   // Classification command response
   typedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {
       float probabily;  // confidence level
       classification_e classification;  // status of detection
       char result[CLASSIFICATION_STRING_SIZE]; // result of classification
   } classification_result_t;
   ```

6. Populate the statistics in the `max78000_statistics_t` structure to be reported to MAX32666:

   ```c
   // MAX78000 statistics field
   typedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {
       uint32_t cnn_duration_us;
       uint32_t capture_duration_us;
       uint32_t communication_duration_us;
       uint32_t total_duration_us;
   } max78000_statistics_t;
   ```

7. Report the classification result and statistics back to MAX32666 using the appropriate QSPI commands. For example, for audio results:

   ```c
   // report classification result
   qspi_slave_send_packet((uint8_t *) &classification_result, sizeof(classification_result),
                           QSPI_PACKET_TYPE_AUDIO_CLASSIFICATION_RES);
   // report statistics
   qspi_slave_send_packet((uint8_t *) &max78000_statistics, sizeof(max78000_statistics),
                           QSPI_PACKET_TYPE_AUDIO_STATISTICS_RES);
   ```

8. Send the raw image as needed (video only) to MAX32666: `send_img()`
