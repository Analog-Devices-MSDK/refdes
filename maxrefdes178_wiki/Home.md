# MAXREFDES178 AI Cube Camera Reference Design

## Introduction
MAXREFDES178 is a reference design based on ADI [MAX78000](https://www.analog.com/en/products/max78000.html#product-overview) Ultra-Low-Power AI processor. It is a cube-shaped device with various sensors and interfaces to implement, test and demonstrate low-power AI applications. The entire design is an open-source project including the hardware. It is possible to build, modify and reprogram existing AI applications in this repository as well as to create brand new applications using new CNN models.

The reference design is a battery-powered device consisting of two electronic boards, a TFT-LCD screen and a Lithium-Ion battery, all assembled in a plastic enclosure. The reference design is equipped with a battery charger and it is possible to recharge the battery using a USB Type-C cable. This enables users to deploy battery-powered AI applications and evaluate them in the field. The device can also operate using an external power source using the same USB Type-C connector.
